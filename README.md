- [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/)
- REST API Interface
- MySQL
- Model View Controller best practices

This RESTful API interface has been deployed to [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/start). It has a [ClearDB addon](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/cleardb) instance that hosts a remote MySQL Database.
